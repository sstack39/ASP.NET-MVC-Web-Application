This project encapsulates many major concepts associated with ASP.NET web-based applications. Specifically utilizing MVC entity core framework.
I created this web application using C# within the Visual Studio Code Platform. At first I used MySQL database, but later changed to SQLite database for 
utilization. 

Features of ASP.NET MVC Web Application include:

- MVC structure (Models, Views, Controllers)
- bootstrap elements to shape UI experience
- security login with admin role
- product data table displayed for all site viewers
- add 'add product' button to display more product information
- SQLite database handling all data storage for product table and security login
- multiple different product details page
- privacy page
- home page
- drop down menu to select different product categories
- utilize models to represent database entities
- utilize database and middleware for returning data from databases to view
- utilize controllers in order to 'controll' how the user interacts with the appliation
